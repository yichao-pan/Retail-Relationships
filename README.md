# Retail-Relationships
Project 1

#Background:
1000ml Retail wants to figure out the optimal spot for discounts and profit.

#Objective:
They want to know the impact of discounts on profits.

#Deliverable:
A 10 min presentation outlining your methodology, reasoning and findings to the sales team. This presentation should have 3-4 recommendations on subcategories and SKUâ€™s.

Hint:
Features to look at are sales, profit, and profit ratio.

#Bonus Round:
What would the impact be if we ran a sale offering that was at least 25% off?
What would the impact be if we decreased all sales over 50% by 10% on sales and profit?
